# Machine Translation from English to Nepali Language

### What is Machine Translation?

Machine Translation (MT) or automated translation is a process when a computer software translates text from one language to another without human involvement.

##### How does Machine Translation Works?

MT works with large amounts of source and target languages that are compared and matched against each other by a machine translation engine. We differentiate three types of machine translation methods:

    * Rules based machine translation
    * Statistical machine translaation
    * Neural machine translation

This project belongs to the third category of machine translation technique.
